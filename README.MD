# Server Performance Configs
Optimised configs aimed for big survival economy servers. That require handling a lot of players on a single server. But I highly recommend customising it for your needs using the guides listed below.  

## Recommendations

### Stay away from these plugins
* **Stacker plugins** - stacking entities causes more lag because the server is than always trying to spawn new mobs. I would recommend stacker plugins only for stacking mobs from spawners and disabling their AI.
* **Item removal plugins** - these "free performance" plugins are most of the time useless as you can "replace" them with item/alt item despawn rates in spigot.yml.
* **Plugin managers** - Using plugins to reload other plugins without restarting the server, can cause glitches.

### Check your timings
Create a timings report, timings can give you a lot of helpful information about what is making your server lag ext.
